    "Financial statements of an organization often conceal more than they reveal. Being able to analyze them and extract meaningful information is an essential skill that financial as well as non-financial professionals should have. Ratio analysis can be used to determine relationships between two elements of the same financial statement or between one element of one financial statement and another element of a different financial statement. This type of analysis can also be used to compare your companys performance to a number or key indicators, including your competitors, industry averages and benchmarks. This course presents and discusses many methods for analyzing financial statements from a non-financial professional's perspective. It determines and interprets the key profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency ratios using scenarios. It also explains horizontal and vertical analysis of the financial statements using real life examples.\n",

Enter smart cities—cities that use 21st century thinking and technology to enable a better quality of life for their citizens. Hosted by Jonathan Reichental (named one of the world's top 100 CIOs in 2017), this short documentary profiles the City of Palo Alto, California. There forward-thinking officials are coming up with creative solutions to problems like traffic and air pollution—and opening up their doors and their data so that community members can get involved. Learn how sensors that bridge the physical and digital worlds and open-data policies are making government more agile and more innovative. Plus, find out how smart cities' technology investments will power a new job market for technical and creative professionals who want to do meaningful work for their communities."

    "This course shows how to review and derive information from datasets using Python. First, get an overview of data science and how it open source libraries like Python can be used for your data analysis need. Then, discover how to set up labs and data interpreters. Next, learn about how you can use pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for numerical processing, scientific programming, and extensive data exploration. With these options at your disposal, you'll be ready for the following chapter which focuses on making predictions using machine learning tools, data classifiers, and clusters. The course concludes with a look at big data and how PySpark can be used for computing.\n",
