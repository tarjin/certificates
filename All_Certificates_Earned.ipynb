    "The R data.table package is rapidly making its name as the number one choice for handling large datasets in R. This online data.table tutorial will bring you from data.table novice to expert in no time. Once you are introduced to the general form of a data.table query, you will learn the techniques to subset your data.table, how to update by reference and how you can use data.table’s set()-family in your workflow. The course finishes with more complex concepts such as indexing, keys and fast ordered joins. Upon completion of the course, you will be able to use data.table in R for a more efficient manipulation and analysis process. Enjoy!"

You'll explore the historical voting of the United Nations General Assembly, including analyzing differences in voting between countries, across time, and among international issues. In the process you'll gain more practice with the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, learn about the broom package for tidying model output, and experience the kind of start-to-finish exploratory analysis common in data science."

    "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called relational databases. Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced ess-que-ell, or sequel). This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!"

In this course you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self-joins, semi-joins, anti-joins and cross joins - fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. You'll fear set theory no more, after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the power of through the challenging topic of subqueries. You will see a visual perspective to grasp the ideas throughout the course using the mediums of Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations."

    "This course builds on what you learned in Data Manipulation in R with dplyr by showing you how to combine data sets with dplyr's two table verbs. In the real world, data comes split across many data sets, but dplyr's core functions are designed to work with single tables of data. In this course, you'll learn the best ways to combine data sets into single tables. You'll learn how to augment columns from one data set with columns from another with mutating joins, how to filter one data set against another with filtering joins, and how to sift through data sets with set operations. Along the way, you'll discover the best practices for building data sets and troubleshooting joins with dplyr. Afterwards, you’ll be well on your way to data manipulation mastery!"

    "It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. For this reason, it is critical to become familiar with the data cleaning process and all of the tools available to you along the way. This course provides a very basic introduction to cleaning data in R using the tidyr, dplyr, and stringr packages. After taking the course you'll be able to go from raw data to awesome insights as quickly and painlessly as possible!"

In this course, you will learn how to describe relationships between two numerical quantities. You will characterize these relationships graphically, in the form of summary statistics, and through simple linear regression models."

First you will master the five verbs of R data manipulation with dplyr: select, mutate, filter, arrange and summarise. Next, you will learn how you can chain your dplyr operations using the pipe operator of the magrittr package. In the final section, the focus is on practicing how to subset your data using the group_by function, and how you can access data stored outside of R in a database. All said and done, you will be familiar with data manipulation tools and techniques that will allow you to efficiently manipulate data."

    "One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another)."

Enter smart cities—cities that use 21st century thinking and technology to enable a better quality of life for their citizens. Hosted by Jonathan Reichental (named one of the world's top 100 CIOs in 2017), this short documentary profiles the City of Palo Alto, California. There forward-thinking officials are coming up with creative solutions to problems like traffic and air pollution—and opening up their doors and their data so that community members can get involved. Learn how sensors that bridge the physical and digital worlds and open-data policies are making government more agile and more innovative. Plus, find out how smart cities' technology investments will power a new job market for technical and creative professionals who want to do meaningful work for their communities."

    "This course shows how to review and derive information from datasets using Python. First, get an overview of data science and how it open source libraries like Python can be used for your data analysis need. Then, discover how to set up labs and data interpreters. Next, learn about how you can use pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for numerical processing, scientific programming, and extensive data exploration. With these options at your disposal, you'll be ready for the following chapter which focuses on making predictions using machine learning tools, data classifiers, and clusters. The course concludes with a look at big data and how PySpark can be used for computing.\n",
