    "Amazon Lightsail is a member of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Compute family. It simplifies the process of deploying a virtual private server using preconfigured templates for a Linux distribution, application, or dev stack—including WordPress, Magento, and LAMP. This short course provides an overview of Lightsail to help you get up and running in this service. Sharif Nijim discusses how it compares with the AWS cloud platform, as well as the kinds of servers you can create in Lightsail, operational metrics for Lightsail servers, data protection, and how to connect Lightsail with AWS through VPC peering. Sharif wraps up the course by touching on advanced concepts, including APIs, SDKs, and the Lightsail CLI.\n",

    "Financial statements of an organization often conceal more than they reveal. Being able to analyze them and extract meaningful information is an essential skill that financial as well as non-financial professionals should have. Ratio analysis can be used to determine relationships between two elements of the same financial statement or between one element of one financial statement and another element of a different financial statement. This type of analysis can also be used to compare your companys performance to a number or key indicators, including your competitors, industry averages and benchmarks. This course presents and discusses many methods for analyzing financial statements from a non-financial professional's perspective. It determines and interprets the key profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency ratios using scenarios.

    "Many real-world data sets contain strings, integers, time-stamps and unstructured data. How do you store data like this so that you can manipulate it and easily retrieve important information? The answer is in a pandas DataFrame! In this course, you'll learn how to use the industry-standard pandas library to import, build, and manipulate DataFrames. With pandas, you'll always be able to convert your data into a form that permits you to analyze it easily. You'll also learn more about NumPy, how it stores data, and its relation to the pandas DataFrame."

However, as a Data Scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. On top of this, you'll wrap up each Chapter by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts."

    "Many anthropologists believe our early ancestors built societies around campfire stories about justice, leadership, and government. Your data science teams will also have complex ideas about their data and results. That's why it takes a well-structured story to communicate these insights to the rest of your organization. It's not simply a matter of creating the perfect Excel sheet or a beautiful graph. You need to tell a story that captures your audience's imagination and encourages them to take some action. In this course, instructor Doug Rose explains how to weave together a great data science story and draw your audience into the story to communicate complex ideas and motivate everyone to make real changes.\n",

    "A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. But at the end of the day your team needs to add real business value. Even the best data science teams won't last long in your organization if they can't generate revenue or lower expenses. The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. These short sprints give you real-time feedback to help keep your team on track. A short sprint will also help your team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data.\n",

    "This course shows how to structure your work within a two-week sprint. See how to work within a data science life cycle (DSLC)—a methodology for cycling through questions, research, and reporting every two weeks. Explore key practices to help your team break down the work so it fits within a two-week sprint. Learn how to use tools like question boards to encourage discussion and find essential questions. And most importantly, learn how to grow your team's shared knowledge and avoid common pitfalls.\n",
