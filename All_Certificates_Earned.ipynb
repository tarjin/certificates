    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most widely used cloud platforms, and the go-to for many organizations looking to reduce costs by adopting a cloud infrastructure strategy. This course starts by examining cloud concepts and best practices. Next, it walks you through how to design your infrastructure to prevent failure. Then, you'll discover how to implement elasticity with automation, and strategies to decouple application components. Then, learn how to optimize for performance and for cost. Last, put concepts into practice by setting up the server-based architectures for a web application in addition to implementing a serverless approach using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.\n",

While most only think of the \"big subject,\" big data, there are many more fields and concepts to explore. Here Barton Poulson explores disciplines such as programming, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, data analysis, visualization, and (yes) big data. He explains why data scientists are now in such demand, and the skills required to succeed in different jobs. He shows how to obtain data from legitimate open-source repositories via web APIs and page scraping, and introduces specific technologies (R, Python, and SQL) and techniques (support vector machines and random forests) for analysis.

    "A proper predictive analytics and data-mining project can involve many people and many weeks. There are also many potential errors to avoid. A \"big picture\" perspective is necessary to keep the project on track. This course provides that perspective through the lens of a veteran practitioner who has completed dozens of real-world projects. Keith McCormick is an independent data miner and author who specializes in predictive models and segmentation analysis, including classification trees, cluster analysis, and association rules. Here he shares his knowledge with you. Walk through each step of a typical project, from defining the problem and gathering the data and resources, to putting the solution into practice. Keith also provides an overview of CRISP-DM (the de facto data-mining methodology) and the nine laws of data mining, which will keep you focused on strategy and business value.\n",
