This online data.table tutorial will bring you from data.table novice to expert in no time. Once you are introduced to the general form of a data.table query, you will learn the techniques to subset your data.table, how to update by reference and how you can use data.table’s set()-family in your workflow. The course finishes with more complex concepts such as indexing, keys and fast ordered joins. Upon completion of the course, you will be able to use data.table in R for a more efficient manipulation and analysis process. Enjoy!"

For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another)."

That's why it's important for your team to use critical thinking to come up with astute, meaningful questions that add real value. A well-crafted question can prevent your team from getting sidetracked on bad assumptions and false conclusions. In this course, author Doug Rose explores the key components of critical reasoning and how to pan for gold in streams of data to search for new questions. You'll learn how to work together as a team to run question meetings, organize important ideas into question trees, and generate quality questions by clarifying key terms, challenging evidence, uncovering misleading statistics, and more.\n",
