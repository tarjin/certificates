    "The Internet of Things (IoT) is more than just smart or connected devices. In this course, learn what IoT is, and how it works from a technical standpoint. Bruce Sinclair provides a broad overview of IoT, explaining each of its main components. He also goes into the software-defined product—the digital twin of the physical product—as well as the hardware-defined product, explaining how sensors and embedded systems help to gather data. Plus, he dives into the network fabric, and explains what external systems are and why it's important to consider them when designing an IoT product.\n",

The answer is in a pandas DataFrame! In this course, you'll learn how to use the industry-standard pandas library to import, build, and manipulate DataFrames. With pandas, you'll always be able to convert your data into a form that permits you to analyze it easily. You'll also learn more about NumPy, how it stores data, and its relation to the pandas DataFrame."

The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice.

And if you're using Python, you'll be definitely using Pandas and NumPy, the third-party packages designed specifically for data analysis. This course provides an opportunity to learn about them. Michele Vallisneri shows how to set up your analysis environment and provides a refresher on the basics of working with data containers in Python. Then he jumps into the big stuff: the power of arrays, indexing, and DataFrames in NumPy and Pandas. He also walks through two sample big-data projects: one using NumPy to analyze weather patterns and the other using Pandas to analyze the popularity of baby names over the last century. Challenges issued along the way help you practice what you've learned.\n",

    "Great data science discoveries are often traced back to someone asking a critical question. That's why it's important for your team to use critical thinking to come up with astute, meaningful questions that add real value. A well-crafted question can prevent your team from getting sidetracked on bad assumptions and false conclusions. In this course, author Doug Rose explores the key components of critical reasoning and how to pan for gold in streams of data to search for new questions. You'll learn how to work together as a team to run question meetings, organize important ideas into question trees, and generate quality questions by clarifying key terms, challenging evidence, uncovering misleading statistics, and more.\n",

    "Many anthropologists believe our early ancestors built societies around campfire stories about justice, leadership, and government. Your data science teams will also have complex ideas about their data and results. That's why it takes a well-structured story to communicate these insights to the rest of your organization. It's not simply a matter of creating the perfect Excel sheet or a beautiful graph. You need to tell a story that captures your audience's imagination and encourages them to take some action. In this course, instructor Doug Rose explains how to weave together a great data science story and draw your audience into the story to communicate complex ideas and motivate everyone to make real changes.\n",

    "A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. But at the end of the day your team needs to add real business value. Even the best data science teams won't last long in your organization if they can't generate revenue or lower expenses. The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. These short sprints give you real-time feedback to help keep your team on track. A short sprint will also help your team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data.\n",
