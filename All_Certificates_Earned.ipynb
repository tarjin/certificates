    "Financial statements of an organization often conceal more than they reveal. Being able to analyze them and extract meaningful information is an essential skill that financial as well as non-financial professionals should have. Ratio analysis can be used to determine relationships between two elements of the same financial statement or between one element of one financial statement and another element of a different financial statement. This type of analysis can also be used to compare your companys performance to a number or key indicators, including your competitors, industry averages and benchmarks. This course presents and discusses many methods for analyzing financial statements from a non-financial professional's perspective. It determines and interprets the key profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency ratios using scenarios. It also explains horizontal and vertical analysis of the financial statements using real life examples.\n",

    "With businesses having to grapple with increasing amounts of data, the need for data reduction has intensified in recent years. To make sense of an overabundance of information, you can use cluster analysis—which allows you to develop inferences about a handful of groups instead of an entire population of individuals—as well as principal components analysis, which exposes latent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, Conrad Carlberg explains how to carry out cluster analysis and principal components analysis using Microsoft Excel, which tends to show more clearly what's going on in the analysis. Then he explains how to carry out the same analysis using R, the open-source statistical computing software, which is faster and richer in analysis options than Excel. Plus, he walks through how to merge the results of cluster analysis and factor analysis to help you break down a few underlying factors according to individuals' membership in just a few clusters.\n",

    "R is the language of big data—a statistical programming language that helps describe, mine, and test relationships between large amounts of data. Author Barton Poulson shows how to use R to model statistical relationships using graphs, calculations, tests, and other analysis tools. Learn how to enter and modify data; create charts, scatter plots, and histograms; examine outliers; calculate correlations; and compute regressions, bivariate associations, and statistics for three or more variables. Challenge exercises with step-by-step solutions allow you to test your skills as you progress.\n",
