    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most widely used cloud platforms, and the go-to for many organizations looking to reduce costs by adopting a cloud infrastructure strategy. This course starts by examining cloud concepts and best practices. Next, it walks you through how to design your infrastructure to prevent failure. Then, you'll discover how to implement elasticity with automation, and strategies to decouple application components. Then, learn how to optimize for performance and for cost. Last, put concepts into practice by setting up the server-based architectures for a web application in addition to implementing a serverless approach using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.\n",

    "Topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Benefits of cloud services\n",
    "- Making architectures scalable\n",

    "Introduction to Data Science provides a comprehensive overview of modern data science: the practice of obtaining, exploring, modeling, and interpreting data. While most only think of the \"big subject,\" big data, there are many more fields and concepts to explore. Here Barton Poulson explores disciplines such as programming, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, data analysis, visualization, and (yes) big data. He explains why data scientists are now in such demand, and the skills required to succeed in different jobs. He shows how to obtain data from legitimate open-source repositories via web APIs and page scraping, and introduces specific technologies (R, Python, and SQL) and techniques (support vector machines and random forests) for analysis. By the end of the course, you should better understand data science's role in making meaningful insights from the complex and large sets of data all around us.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike many other fields of design, cities aren't created by any one specialist or expert. There are many contributors to urban change, including ordinary citizens who can have a great impact on improving the cities in which they live. By exploring a diverse range of urban design projects around the world, Urbanized frames a global discussion on the future of cities.\n",
