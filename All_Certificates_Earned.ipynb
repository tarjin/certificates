    "It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. For this reason, it is critical to become familiar with the data cleaning process and all of the tools available to you along the way. This course provides a very basic introduction to cleaning data in R using the tidyr, dplyr, and stringr packages. After taking the course you'll be able to go from raw data to awesome insights as quickly and painlessly as possible!"

    "One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another)."

    "Cities are changing rapidly—growing in size and density, creating more waste, and using more resources. To solve the problems these pressures create, city governments need to think different. Enter smart cities—cities that use 21st century thinking and technology to enable a better quality of life for their citizens. Hosted by Jonathan Reichental (named one of the world's top 100 CIOs in 2017), this short documentary profiles the City of Palo Alto, California. There forward-thinking officials are coming up with creative solutions to problems like traffic and air pollution—and opening up their doors and their data so that community members can get involved. Learn how sensors that bridge the physical and digital worlds and open-data policies are making government more agile and more innovative. Plus, find out how smart cities' technology investments will power a new job market for technical and creative professionals who want to do meaningful work for their communities."

    "This course shows how to review and derive information from datasets using Python. First, get an overview of data science and how it open source libraries like Python can be used for your data analysis need. Then, discover how to set up labs and data interpreters. Next, learn about how you can use pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for numerical processing, scientific programming, and extensive data exploration. With these options at your disposal, you'll be ready for the following chapter which focuses on making predictions using machine learning tools, data classifiers, and clusters. The course concludes with a look at big data and how PySpark can be used for computing.\n",
