    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most widely used cloud platforms, and the go-to for many organizations looking to reduce costs by adopting a cloud infrastructure strategy. This course starts by examining cloud concepts and best practices. Next, it walks you through how to design your infrastructure to prevent failure. Then, you'll discover how to implement elasticity with automation, and strategies to decouple application components. Then, learn how to optimize for performance and for cost. Last, put concepts into practice by setting up the server-based architectures for a web application in addition to implementing a serverless approach using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.\n",

In fact, it is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose your data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, you'll apply all of the techniques you've learned to a case study in which you'll clean a real-world Gapminder dataset!"
