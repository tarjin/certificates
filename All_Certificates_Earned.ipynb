For this reason, it is critical to become familiar with the data cleaning process and all of the tools available to you along the way. This course provides a very basic introduction to cleaning data in R using the tidyr, dplyr, and stringr packages. After taking the course you'll be able to go from raw data to awesome insights as quickly and painlessly as possible!"

Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another)."

You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. On top of this, you'll wrap up each Chapter by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts."

First you'll enter the wonderful world of iterators, objects that you have already encountered in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools that form a basic component in the toolbox of all modern Data Scientists working in Python. You'll end the course by working through a case study in which you'll apply all of the techniques you learned both in this course as well as the prequel.

Your data science teams will also have complex ideas about their data and results. That's why it takes a well-structured story to communicate these insights to the rest of your organization. It's not simply a matter of creating the perfect Excel sheet or a beautiful graph. You need to tell a story that captures your audience's imagination and encourages them to take some action. In this course, instructor Doug Rose explains how to weave together a great data science story and draw your audience into the story to communicate complex ideas and motivate everyone to make real changes.\n",

    "A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. But at the end of the day your team needs to add real business value. Even the best data science teams won't last long in your organization if they can't generate revenue or lower expenses. The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. These short sprints give you real-time feedback to help keep your team on track. A short sprint will also help your team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data.\n",
