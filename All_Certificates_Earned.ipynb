    "Once you've started learning tools for data manipulation and visualization like dplyr and ggplot2, this course gives you a chance to use them in action on a real dataset. You'll explore the historical voting of the United Nations General Assembly, including analyzing differences in voting between countries, across time, and among international issues. In the process you'll gain more practice with the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, learn about the broom package for tidying model output, and experience the kind of start-to-finish exploratory analysis common in data science."

    "It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. For this reason, it is critical to become familiar with the data cleaning process and all of the tools available to you along the way. This course provides a very basic introduction to cleaning data in R using the tidyr, dplyr, and stringr packages. After taking the course you'll be able to go from raw data to awesome insights as quickly and painlessly as possible!"

In this course, you will learn how to describe relationships between two numerical quantities. You will characterize these relationships graphically, in the form of summary statistics, and through simple linear regression models."

    "In this interactive tutorial, you will learn how to perform sophisticated dplyr techniques to carry out your data manipulation with R. First you will master the five verbs of R data manipulation with dplyr: select, mutate, filter, arrange and summarise. Next, you will learn how you can chain your dplyr operations using the pipe operator of the magrittr package. In the final section, the focus is on practicing how to subset your data using the group_by function, and how you can access data stored outside of R in a database. All said and done, you will be familiar with data manipulation tools and techniques that will allow you to efficiently manipulate data."

In this course, you'll learn how to use graphical and numerical techniques to begin uncovering the structure of your data. Which variables suggest interesting relationships? Which observations are unusual? By the end of the course, you'll be able to answer these questions and more, while generating graphics that are both insightful and beautiful."

    "One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another)."

    "Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations—collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments—form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in the context of a general process of investigation: 1) identify a question or problem; 2) collect relevant data on the topic; 3) analyze the data; and 4) form a conclusion. In this course, you'll focus on the first two steps of the process."

    "Tidy data is a data format that provides a standardized way of organizing data values within a dataset. By leveraging tidy data principles, statisticians, analysts, and data scientists can spend less time cleaning data and more time tackling the more compelling aspects of data analysis. In this course, learn about the principles of tidy data, and discover how to create and manipulate data tibbles—transforming them from source data into tidy formats. Instructor Mike Chapple uses the R programming language and the tidyverse packages to teach the concept of data wrangling—the data cleaning and data transformation tasks that consume a substantial portion of analysts' time. He wraps up with three hands-on case studies that help to reinforce the data wrangling principles and tactics covered in this course.\n",
