    "There's a critical link between an organization's goals and its performance metrics. A beautiful mission statement is nothing without specific, actionable measures that provide incentives to succeed. These actionable numeric measures are called key performance indicators (KPIs) and can be organized into a structure called the balanced scorecard. The scorecard helps you quantify business performance over time: weeks, months, quarters, or even years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, accounting professors Jim and Kay Stice explain what KPIs your business should consider in a balanced scorecard, from financial goals to employee and customer satisfaction. They describe how to craft a clear mission statement that complements your KPIs, and how to tie performance to incentives. Plus, get a look at KPIs in action, as Jim and Kay break down a case study examining a trucking company's balanced scorecard.\n",

    "- The importance of KPIs and measuring performance\n",
    "- Financial goals and measure\n",

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis.

To make sense of an overabundance of information, you can use cluster analysis—which allows you to develop inferences about a handful of groups instead of an entire population of individuals—as well as principal components analysis, which exposes latent variables. \n",

Then he explains how to carry out the same analysis using R, the open-source statistical computing software, which is faster and richer in analysis options than Excel. Plus, he walks through how to merge the results of cluster analysis and factor analysis to help you break down a few underlying factors according to individuals' membership in just a few clusters.\n",

    "R is the language of big data—a statistical programming language that helps describe, mine, and test relationships between large amounts of data. Author Barton Poulson shows how to use R to model statistical relationships using graphs, calculations, tests, and other analysis tools. Learn how to enter and modify data; create charts, scatter plots, and histograms; examine outliers; calculate correlations; and compute regressions, bivariate associations, and statistics for three or more variables. Challenge exercises with step-by-step solutions allow you to test your skills as you progress.\n",
