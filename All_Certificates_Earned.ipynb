    "Agile teams need a lightweight way to report their progress. Agile reports should be simple and easy to read, and radiate information across the room to the entire team. In this course, agile expert Doug Rose outlines a process for reporting on the progress of your agile project. He shows how to prioritize the product backlog, update the taskboard, and monitor the project's health with burndown charts. You'll also see the most common pitfalls, such as retrofitting and working with distributed teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: Watch the bonus chapter at the end of this course where Doug answers common questions about the agile mindset, including what types of projects would be the best fit.\n",

This gives you the information needed to do ideation exercises. After ideation, bring things back to reality by creating scenarios, which you use to build a prototype UI for planning purposes. By investing time in these UCD activities, you'll enter the development phase of your project with a much better understanding of what you need to build to delight your users. Having a set of measurable goals and a prototype interface makes it easier to plan your implementation and set interim deliverables that you know will deliver value to your users.\n",

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis.
